This is just an assortment of Beeper enhancements/tricks/etc.

## Elganter Theme

First, a more elegant (IMHO) theme for the desktop client: https://github.com/dzg/beeper/blob/main/dzg-beeper-eleganter-theme.css

This should work with both Dark and Light themes.

### Features:
   - Flatter. No borders.
   - Sexier 'Spacebar'
   - Muted room indicator
   - Less obtrusive unread
   - Full width date separators
   - No 'Send' text, â–¶ is good enough for me
   - Bigger monospace text areas in prefs
   - Different fonts for UI and Messages
   - No purple gradient
